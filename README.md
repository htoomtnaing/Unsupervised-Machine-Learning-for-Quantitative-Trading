<b/>Executive Summary: <b/><br/>
The financial industry continually seeks innovative strategies to enhance portfolio management and 
investment returns. This report explores the integration of unsupervised machine learning techniques—
specifically K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering—into the development of trading strategies. By 
identifying coherent clusters of financial assets, these techniques have shown promise in improving riskadjusted returns, 
outperforming traditional benchmarks such as the SPY Buy & Hold strategy. <br/>

Our analysis demonstrates that clustering-based strategies, particularly employing K-Means Clustering
with k = 6 and Agglomerative Clustering with k=3, offered a superior balance of risk and return, as 
evidenced by their Sharpe ratios. Both methods yielded impressive cumulative returns over the last 5 years 
(2018 – 2023) compared to the S&P500 benchmark. However, these strategies also present a higher 
maximum drawdown during the same period, indicating a potential increase in risk exposure that came with 
higher returns. This trade-off is a critical consideration for portfolio managers aiming to optimize returns 
while managing risk levels. <br/>

The report underscores the dynamic nature of financial markets, where asset behaviour is influenced 
by market conditions and external events, such as economic disruptions and geopolitical tensions. It 
suggests that an adaptive strategy, which includes regular re-evaluation of cluster configurations and 
reallocation of assets, can better respond to such fluctuations. <br/>

In conclusion, the application of Unsupervised Learning, particularly K-Means and Agglomerative 
Clustering presents a significant advancement in financial analytics, offering a data-driven approach to 
portfolio management. However, investors may need to consider the risk-return trade-offs when choosing 
these strategies. Further experiments in other Clustering techniques can lead to better understanding of the
underlying factors driving the markets, more informed decision-making and improved investment 
outcomes
